# Snaskblock

Do you shop food on [Mathem](https://www.mathem.se) or [Coop](https://www.coop.se)? Are you having trouble controlling yourself when it comes to candy, snacks and other unhealthy food?

Then the Snaskblock extension for Chrome is your best friend! It effectively removes unhealthy products from listings, search results and navigation. If you in some way manage to reach a product page for something unhealthy then it sets off an alarm of shame. And don't think the alarm will leave anyone unnoticed of your dubious behaviour if you put any of these products in your shopping cart.

Should you struggle through the alarm you still have to click your mouse 500 times ([because clicks burns calories you know](#)) before being able to complete your order.

Here's an image of one of us after using Snaskblock for just one week. This can be you.
