# SnaskBlock

Do you shop food on [Mathem](https://www.mathem.se) or [Coop](https://www.coop.se)? Are you having trouble controlling yourself when it comes to candy, snacks and other unhealthy food?

Then the SnaskBlock extension for Chrome is your best friend! It effectively removes unhealthy products from listings, search results and navigation. If you in some way manage to reach a product page for something unhealthy it will set off an alarm of shame. And don't even think that the alarm will leave anyone unnoticed of your dubious behaviour if you put any of these products in your shopping cart.

Should you struggle through the alarm you still have to click your mouse 1000 times ([because clicks burns calories you know](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/11/someone-calculated-how-many-calories-a-mouse-click-burns/)) before being able to complete your order.
